## Global Constraints

- Node 22, npm 11 (match existing CI).
- `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` (match existing CI).
- `VITE_ENV_LABEL` must be set to `"Staging"` for preview builds so the `EnvBadge` component renders visibly — production (main) deploys must NOT set it.
- `VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` must be injected (match existing CI).
- Never set `VITE_RELEASE=1` for staging (no obfuscation — debugging must be possible).
- Never set `VITE_DEMO_MODE=1` for staging (staging must mirror real behavior).
- Supabase env vars (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) are NOT injected into staging builds — staging must not write to production Supabase (I2/I3 safety).
- The `prebuild` script (`node scripts/bundle-trezor-connect.mjs`) runs automatically via npm's `prebuild` hook when `npm run build` is called — do not invoke it separately.

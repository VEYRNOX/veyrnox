# Veyrnox — project guide for Claude Code

Veyrnox is a self-custody, coercion-resistant crypto wallet (Vite + React + Capacitor;
ethers v6; @noble / @scure). Web + mobile (iOS/Android via Capacitor). The seed is the
identity; the app never holds keys server-side.

## Hard rules (do not violate)

- **Mainnet unlocked 2026-06-17.** Internal security audit complete; owner sign-off
  recorded in `docs/audit-triage/internal-audit-2026-06-17.md`. `ALLOW_MAINNET = true`,
  `ALLOW_BTC_MAINNET = true`, `ALLOW_SOL_MAINNET = true`. Both audits are now complete:
  the internal audit (2026-06-17, the mainnet gate) and the independent ECC third-party
  audit (2026-06-23). A 2026-06-27 independent review of unvalidated audit claims
  (`docs/audit-2026-06-27-unvalidated-claims.md`) identified 3 HIGH + 5 MEDIUM findings —
  mitigations landed in PRs #421–#426 (see §8a in `docs/Feature-Status.md`). "Internal"
  is never to be presented as "independent" (I4 honesty).
  A 2026-06-28 internal static-analysis pass (0C/4H/11M/8L) fixed 10 of 11 actionable
  findings (PRs #433, #440–#443); H-NEW-D (iOS SE) + F-01/F-02 (biometric OS-ACL) +
  F-09 (RASP device) + M-K (passkey counter) remain open, all native/device-gated.
  INTERNAL pass — not independent. (See `docs/Audit.scope.md`.)
  A 2026-07-01 internal static-analysis audit (Hardware KEK focused — WebAuthn PRF KEK,
  iOS SE KEK, Android StrongBox KEK) found 1C/9H/12M/6L; 10 remediable findings fixed in
  PRs #520–#522; C-1 (CRITICAL: Android HMAC fixed input — v2 protocol migration required)
  and native/device-gated findings (iOS-F5, iOS-F3, H-1, H-2/iOS-F11, iOS-F9 evidence gap)
  remain open. H-NEW-D CLOSED (SE ECIES confirmed in ObjC at `HardwareKekPlugin.m:78`).
  INTERNAL pass — not independent. See `docs/audit-2026-07-01-kek-internal.md`.
- **Verify, don't assert.** An asset/feature is "verified" ONLY after a real on-chain
  testnet transaction confirms on a block explorer with a txid the user supplies. Passing
  tests, clean review, or a green suite are NOT verification. Never flip an asset `status`
  to `live` or write "verified" without a real explorer-confirmed txid.
- **Status tags.** Every control/feature is BUILT (in code, testnet/provisional), TARGET
  (designed, audit-gated, not confirmed in shipped code), PLANNED (roadmap), or
  HONEST-DISABLED (present but off on principle). Code-complete + tests green = BUILT at
  most, never "verified".
- **Audit gate (§24).** The **internal audit** is the hard gate: it reviews the
  architecture BEFORE any backend or seed-touching build, and is the pass that opens
  mainnet. (An independent audit is also performed for depth, but does not gate.) RASP,
  hardware KEK, device attestation, network hardening, and cloud recovery are
  TARGET/PLANNED — do not build them blind; they need real-device verification and the audit.
- **No fake security.** Never mock a security control to look real. If something can't be
  delivered honestly, honest-disable it (I4: fail honest, fail closed).

## Hardware KEK Phase 1/2 Rollout

**Phase 1 (Shipping):** Web wallet PIN protected by WebAuthn PRF
- Platform authenticator binds each unlock to device
- Offline-seizure gap closed (PIN exhaustion requires platform auth per-use)
- Supported: Chrome ≥99, Firefox ≥108; graceful fallback Safari (password-only, ≥12 chars)
- Status: ✅ Code-complete, unit-tested (1973/1973 passing), browser UAT pending testnet txids

**Phase 2 (Q3 2026):** Native hardware KEK on iOS/Android
- iOS: Secure Enclave HMAC-SHA256 (ECIES) + biometric ACL. 🟡 BUILT, device-verified
  (PARTIAL) 2026-07-01 on iPhone 17 Pro Max: two real Sepolia sends confirmed on-chain
  from a KEK-enrolled vault (PR #495). 2026-07-01 INTERNAL audit: H-NEW-D CLOSED —
  `kSecAttrTokenIDSecureEnclave` confirmed present in `HardwareKekPlugin.m:78`; SE ECIES
  design correct at native ObjC layer. Remaining open native items: iOS-F5 (H factor in
  NSData not zeroed — requires NSMutableData patch + Mac build), iOS-F3 (deprecated
  kSecUseOperationPrompt — requires LAContext + Mac/Xcode). iOS-F9 evidence gap: SE unlock
  log trace not captured for the existing Sepolia sends; iOS device-verified status remains
  PARTIAL. H-2/iOS-F11 (biometric cache not bound to enrollment set) open on both platforms.
  Outstanding: SE-unlock log trace capture, biometric re-enrollment invalidation test,
  KEK-gated Sepolia txid, independent audit. Note: C-1 CRITICAL (Android HMAC fixed input)
  also affects the overall KEK design context — see Android bullet.
- Android: StrongBox HMAC-SHA256 + biometric-only gate (no credential fallback). ✅
  BUILT, end-to-end device-verified 2026-07-01 on a Pixel 10 Pro XL (Android 16/API 36):
  enroll → cold restart → StrongBox-gated unlock → badge stays "Hardware Protection ON".
  Three stacked bugs found and fixed to get here (PRs #497, #499): (1) badge measured
  key-presence, not vault-wrap — reconciled against `hasVaultKekWrap()`; (2)
  `@aparajita/capacitor-secure-storage@8.0.0` persisted via async `SharedPreferences.apply()`,
  losing writes on app-kill — patched to synchronous `.commit()` via patch-package
  (Android-only; iOS Keychain was unaffected); (3) every unlock silently re-wrapped the
  vault back to bare Argon2id via `createVault()` — fixed with a KEK-preserving
  `saveVaultContents()`. Tests: keystore 95/95, keystore+WalletProvider 116/116.
  Caveat: the `.commit()` fix is a patch-package patch — requires a clean plugin
  recompile (Gradle caches the AAR). 2026-07-01 INTERNAL audit additional findings:
  C-1 (CRITICAL) — HMAC input is a global fixed constant; all enrolled Android vaults
  derive the same H from the same HMAC input string; requires per-enrollment `kekSalt`
  binding (v2 protocol migration, protocol-breaking change, tracked separately).
  JS-layer fix code-complete in PR #529 (open, pending merge, 2026-07-02): `native.js`
  now generates `kekSalt` before calling `getHardwareFactor`, passes `{ kekSalt }` to it,
  and stamps `hardwareKekVersion: 2` on the vault blob; Kotlin plugin was already patched.
  4/4 C-1 contract tests + 172/172 keystore tests pass. NOT device-verified (needs
  on-device re-enroll + cold restart + KEK-gated Sepolia txid on v2 path). INTERNAL — not
  independently audited. PR #529 is open and not yet merged.
  H-1 — StrongBox tier not surfaced to user; TEE/software fallback silent (UI update needed).
  FIXED in PR #527 (merged 2026-07-02): `tierBadge.js` pure helper maps
  `securityLevelName` → badge label/variant; `HardwareKekSettings.jsx` reads real tier
  from `getVaultKekTier()` and renders the correct badge (StrongBox Protected / TEE
  Protected / Hardware Protection ON / WebAuthn Protected); `native.js` `enrollKek` stores
  `hardwareKekTier` in vault blob and exposes `getVaultKekTier()` accessor.
  H-2/iOS-F11 — biometric cache not bound to enrollment set on both platforms; requires
  custom Capacitor plugin. M-3 fixed (PR #522): `detectTamper()` now fail-closed
  (`getOrElse { true }`). H-4 fixed (PR #522): zero-vector H check in `hardware.js`.
  Outstanding: C-1 v2 migration (JS layer code-complete in PR #529, pending merge; device
  verification still required), KEK-gated Sepolia send + txid, biometric re-enrollment
  invalidation test, StrongBox tier enforcement, independent audit.
  H-1 UI surfacing: FIXED PR #527 (merged 2026-07-02).
  See `docs/hardware-kek-phase-plan.md`, `docs/Feature-Status.md` §4, and
  `docs/audit-2026-07-01-kek-internal.md` for full evidence.
- Status is BUILT + device-verified for both platforms (Android end-to-end,
  iOS partial / no SE-unlock log trace) — 2026-07-01 INTERNAL static-analysis audit
  complete (1C/9H/12M/6L; 10 fixed PRs #520–#522; C-1 CRITICAL JS-layer code-complete PR
  #529 pending merge; H-1 FIXED PR #527). NOT independently
  audited, NOT "verified" in the on-chain/asset sense (no KEK-gated testnet txid on
  either platform's hardware-unlock path yet).

## Security invariants

- I1 — keys never leave the device. I2 — no silent data egress. I3 — deniability mode
  makes zero backend calls. I4 — fail honest, fail closed. I5 — backend untrusted by design.
- **I6 — Hardware Binding:** PIN-cohort DEK wrapped under KEK = HKDF(H ‖ C) — ordered
  concatenation of H then C as the HKDF IKM (NOT XOR; corrected per the ECC KEK audit
  2026-07-01 — code is `kek.js: combineKek`, domain `veyrnox/kek/v1/combine(H||C)`)
  - H: Hardware factor (web: WebAuthn PRF; iOS: Secure Enclave; Android: StrongBox)
  - C: Password/PIN-derived factor (Argon2id)
  - Requirement: Both H and C must be present; missing either throws (fail-closed)

## Demo mode (known trap)

Demo mode triggers on `?demo=1`, `VITE_DEMO_MODE=1`, native dev, OR a persisted
`veyrnox-demo=1` in localStorage (persists silently across reloads). Demo shows fake
seeded balances and fake sends. Before any real verification: clear demo (visit `/?demo=0`),
confirm a fresh real wallet shows 0.0 on-chain and no demo simulation box.

## Dev send ungate (testnet verification)

To send `receive_only` assets in dev for verification: set `VITE_DEV_UNGATE_SEND=1` via a
`.env.local` file (git-ignored) — NOT an inline shell var (fails on Windows/PowerShell).
This flips the gate decision only, never asset status, and is dead-code-eliminated from
production builds. The DEV UNGATE banner shows only on a receive_only asset, never on ETH.

## Wallet model

One HD seed derives per-chain accounts (Model B): a "wallet" is a seed; the Send screen's
asset selector chooses which asset/chain to send. EVM assets (ETH, MATIC, ARB, OP, AVAX,
BNB) share one secp256k1 m/44'/60' address; ERC-20s (USDC/USDT) are contract calls on it;
BTC (m/84'/UTXO/PSBT) and SOL (ed25519/SLIP-0010) have their own addresses and are fully
wired — both are LIVE with verified testnet txids (see `src/wallet-core/assets.js`).
AVAX and BNB share the EVM address and are now LIVE as well — both sent via the full
in-app UI path on testnet (AVAX Fuji `0x3697e0d…`, re-confirmed on-chain 2026-06-22;
BNB BSC-testnet `0x1a6ee75…`, per session record + owner confirmation, not yet
independently re-confirmed on-chain). All 10 assets are LIVE — see `src/wallet-core/assets.js`.

## WalletConnect security controls (BUILT, 2026-06-27)

`src/lib/WalletConnectProvider.jsx` has been through a post-audit security hardening
sweep. Key controls now on main:
- **C3 — RASP pre-sign gate:** `presignGate()` runs before every WC signing handler;
  blocked → `rejectRequest` + return, key never touched (I4).
- **H7 — EIP-712 chain binding:** `eth_signTypedData_v4` validates `domain.chainId` vs
  WC session CAIP-2 chain; mismatch → `CHAINID_MISMATCH` reject. No-chainId domain
  signs through (EIP-712 backwards-compat).
- **H8 — personal_sign address binding:** resolves EIP-1474 vs MetaMask-legacy param
  order; rejects if neither param is the wallet's own address (I4).
- **M9 — 1M gas cap:** dApp-supplied gas is clamped to 1,000,000; estimates are also
  capped.
- **M11 — session expiry:** `assertSessionLive` runs before any key operation;
  expired/absent session → reject + throw (I4).
- **H-A — web vault password minimum:** `validateWebVaultPassword()` enforces ≥12 chars
  on web mainnet (`ALLOW_MAINNET = true`); `WEB_VAULT_PASSWORD_TOO_SHORT` on short input.
- **H-NEW-4/6 — KEK zeroing:** `web.js` wraps full KEK/DEK lifetime in `try/finally`;
  H, KEK, H2 copies all zeroed on every path.
- **H14/H15/H16 — KEK honest naming:** misleading "hardware" names removed from
  software-layer controls; `isSecureHardwareAvailable()` is the honest gate.
- **H-C — mainnet gate consolidation:** `SendCrypto.jsx` imports compile-time
  `ALLOW_MAINNET` from `networks.js` (not a runtime env var). Dead-code-eliminated in prod.

## Per-chain gotchas

- BNB testnet: enforces a minimum gas price; the "Slow" fee tier can underprice and get
  rejected — use Standard+.
- USDT: no official Tether Sepolia; uses an Aave faucet stand-in.
- WalletConnect: test PINs/passwords must be ≥12 chars (H-A minimum on mainnet builds).
  Use `ALLOW_MAINNET = false` in test env or use ≥12-char test secrets.

## Environment

- Windows (Git Bash / MINGW64). iOS native build is NOT possible here (needs a Mac).
- Use `.env.local` for env flags, not inline shell vars.

## Design system

UI follows the Veyrnox design system (see the design-system skill): calm near-black
surfaces (#050608 → #1D222B), one teal accent (#4ADAC2 = verified), Schibsted Grotesk for
prose / IBM Plex Mono for verifiable values (addresses, amounts, fees), deniability by
default (never show wallet count/list), plain-language risk before signing.

## Working pattern

- Reconnaissance before changes; report root cause before fixing.
- Pure helpers + unit tests where logic can be extracted (the codebase pattern).
- One moving part at a time. Don't mark anything verified without the user's on-chain txid.

## Multi-agent working pattern (the "team")

Treat substantial work as a team of specialists, dispatched in parallel where the work is
independent. The team is committed to the repo, so every session has it:

- **Subagents** (`.claude/agents/`): `veyrnox-recon` (read-only mapping + root cause),
  `veyrnox-ui` (design-system UI/a11y, preview-verified), `veyrnox-security-tdd` (wallet-core
  fixes via strict TDD, never fake security), and `veyrnox-honest-reviewer` (correctness +
  the honesty bar). Dispatch via the Agent tool; fan several out in ONE message to run them
  concurrently. Give each agent only its own files — never let two parallel agents edit the
  same file.
- **Command** (`.claude/commands/parallel-fix.md`): `/parallel-fix <area>` — recon → fan out
  one implementer per independent item → honest review → integrate & verify.
- **Workflow** (`.claude/workflows/branch-review.js`): run the `branch-review` workflow to
  review the current branch vs main across correctness / security-honesty / design-system /
  a11y, with each finding adversarially verified before it is reported.

### Orchestration pattern — pick one automatically, every session

Before starting any substantial task, choose the orchestration pattern that fits. Do not ask
the user which to use — read the request, apply the table, proceed.

| Signal in the request | Pattern | How to apply |
|---|---|---|
| Fixed known targets, independent work (e.g. "fix X and Y", "review these 3 files") | **Parallel Execution** | Fan agents out in ONE message so they run concurrently. Merge results before replying. |
| Open-ended discovery ("find all X", "audit everything", unknown count of targets) | **Dynamic Spawner** | Dispatch `dynamic-spawner` agent. It discovers scope at runtime, plans spawns, then synthesizes. |
| Request spans multiple domains OR involves a destructive/irreversible action (push, delete, send, deploy, wipe) | **Router + Human Gate** | Dispatch `router-human-loop` agent first. It classifies, routes, and presents a per-action confirm gate before anything destructive runs. |

**Tie-break rules:**
- Any destructive action present → Router + Human Gate wins, regardless of other signals.
- Scope unknown → Dynamic Spawner, even if the work also looks parallel.
- Scope known + no destructive actions → Parallel Execution.

Rules that still bind every agent: reconnaissance before changes; one moving part at a time;
security-sensitive files (seed/keys/signing/auth) are off-limits to cosmetic work; and nothing
is "verified" without the user's real on-chain txid.
